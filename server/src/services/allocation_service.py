"""allocation_service — per-strategy fund accounting.

Live strategies require an explicit allocation: a commitment of (token, amount)
from a specific wallet. Paper strategies do not.

- record_allocation: called when a strategy transitions to `live` (via
  PATCH /strategies/{id}/status with an `allocation` block). Validates the
  wallet exists; inserts an active allocation row.
- release_allocation: called when a live strategy is deactivated or
  archived. Marks the strategy's active allocation as inactive and stamps
  released_at.
- get_active_allocation: lookup helper, returns Allocation or None.

Invariant: at most one active allocation per strategy_id. We don't enforce
this at the DB level (would need a partial unique index), but the release
logic and the strategy-service transitions make it true in practice.
